<h3>Welcome to HumbleCasa!</h3><br>
<p>
	To get started you need to register your property. You can have more than one property and manage services for each property separately - you'll see an option to add more properties after you create your first one.
</p>
<p>
	We're going to ask you for info such as your address, including zip code, and any special instructions  that service providers might need to access your house. 
</p>
<p>
	This info might include: the code to your security gate, the location of outdoor water faucets, and which doorway you'd like service folks to enter through. <b>Only your selected service providers can see these details</b> but we understand if you don't want to enter it now - you can always contact your providers over the phone or in person to give them this info.
</P>
