Hello!

HumbleCasa.com is a scheduling and payment site for homeowners to connect with service providers like you! HumbleCasa enables homeowners to schedule a service, receive an emailed report when it's done, and pay with their credit on file. It is ideal for 2nd home owners or anyone with a busy lifestyle who prefers to manage their home online.

The benefits for you are numerous: more satisfied customers, emailed notifications of new service requests, an online calendar of scheduled work, tools to assign work and manage your workforce, and secure credit card payments with funds transferred to your account within 7 days of completing work. No more missed phone calls, mailing invoices, and chasing down payments!

Our fees are more than reasonable - typically less than $5 per month for each active customer - and there are no set fees. We only make money if you're making money. We're also able to offer better credit card processing rates than you might be able to get on your owns (2.9% plus $.55 per transaction). And you'll find that homeowners are willing to pay a premium to use a home servicer with the online tools that HumbleCasa provides for you. Your first month on the site is free and we offer a money-back guarantee if you're not completely satisfied.
	
How did you get a new customer if you haven't sign-up for the site? We populated HumbleCasa with your company and with other top service providers in your area. And now a homeowner has requested to be your customer through the site! All you need to do is activate your account at HumbleCasa and we'll allow you to see your new customers.
